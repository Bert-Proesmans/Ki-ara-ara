Kiara the phoenix

Has a big heart, and a sharp gaze. 
Only nice thighs leave her dazed.. 
She holds her chickens in the highest esteem. 
Take this knowledge to escape her fiery flames, because THE USUAL ROOM IS NOT A MEME


~Words are hard~
They don't break your bones
Words are hard
They express more than moans
Words are hard
I croak and stutter
Words are hard
I hate this inarticulacy
Words are hard
That's why I'm practicing my expressivity

# Kiara's goodbye

THEME; Leaving doesn't mean goodbye.
SCENE; Flashback + evening dinner scene

** Calli
*** Headstrong
*** Seiso
** Kiara
*** Airhead
*** Overjoyed/"spring in the field"

~I don't need advice or emotional support. Fierce passion will overcome any challenge!~
~Unwavering trust in friends overcomes the tallest challenges~

;;
"... Calli... What are you doing?"

I notice my pink-haired friend trudging along the sidewalk. From the opposite side of the street I'm waving at her like a crazy person.

"...? Carrying my Groceries. What's up, Kusotori?"

Using her arms as a cradle I see she's barely holding up a few bottles of wine, vegetables, and a small bag of rice.

In my enthousiasm I sprint up to her, dodging cyclists on the way. Oof, that was a miscalculation.

She offers me her shoulder to take a breather. I shouldn't do intense activities at literally the hottest hour of the day!

"Calli, where's the bag?"

"What bag? This body has two good arms and hands. I can carry my gro.. ceries just fine!"

"You almost dropped that tho..."

"... hmph. I ain't gonna be paying no extra fee for some stinkin plastic bag."

The brutality of her sneer sent a shiver down my spine. That was sooo in character!

>>OH CALLI!<<

>>It's Calli's way or no way<<

This must be about one of her principles, right? She mentions them sometimes at totally random moments.

"~Save money where possible!~" or was it "~Only spend money on the necessary things!~"? For real, those just sound the same to me.

She continues trotting forward and I take a second to save a mental picture of the moment. I feel my face contract with a smile.

"..."

A cold sensation constricts my throat. What should have been enthusiastic kirring at Calli was replaced with silence.

I feel my chest compressing as if I'm getting tightly hugged. 

Slightly annoyed I look over my shoulder to see who pushed himself against me. Nothing...

The stir on the street, the noises from passerby cars and bicycles, all is engulfed by a pitch. black. nothingness...

But my body remains, somehow frozen in space. I became a bystander while the world sank into a dark bottomless sea.

Every fiber in my body tries to resist this forced position. So much so that my muscles start to ache, And I can't even move a finger. 

The warm memories I hold dearly become overwhelmed by loneliness.

My body aches. Tears flow down my cheecks. I don't want this! 

This powerlessness is nauseating. The heavy beating of my heart resonates painfully inside my head.

>>Agony emerges from deep within my stomach as Calli slowly sinks into the pool of black.<<

The last strands of Calli's hair disappear from sight. No! No! No! Calli don't leave me!

She was gulped down by the same darkness that's holding a firm grip onto my body.

Something inside me snapped...

A huge orange blaze spews like a geyser from my gut! The spectacle generates a comforting warmth.

>> My newfound warmth is melting away this overbearing darkness like snow. <<
This newfound ability is melting away the effects of the overbearing darkness.

I try to collect my thoughts. Calli is not forgetting about me, I'll make sure of it!

On my back a new fire takes form of feathery wings. They are huge, like 3 times my arm span, and beautiful!

I feel graceful. This aura, and these colors... they're somehow a little familiar.

"All I have to do is just keep moving forward" I whisper as if it was some spell incantation.

The flames burn stronger, radiating a blindingly brilliant light. I can't see anything but notice my body falling down for a second.

"..."

"... why I think this brand is better."

"..."

"... hmm?"

"..." 

I blink. It doesn't look like I'm on fire.

"... Kiara..."

Hesitantly I touch my chest with my left hand. Everything certainly feels normal...

"... Oi! Kusotori!"

I looked up and turned to what made that noise, straight into Calli's eyes. She's leering back.

"Yeah! I think so too!" I responded aiming for a natural tone, while I internally scramble to remember what we were talking about. Was it about wine?

I can tell that she's not convinced. Call me a bird brain all you want but I can still tell someone's facial expression. That raised eyebrow and doubtful expression on her face is a ~dead~ giveaway.

"... uh-huh. So tell me, what brand of wine do I like again?"

>>I can't really hide anything from Calli anymore.<<
Ah... shit. She just had to confirm it didn't she? I'm sure my face is now panicky.

Oh man, we've known each other for too long! Convincingly lying to her will be next to impossible ... DISTRACTION TIME!

"Uhh... H-How is that bag holding up for you now?" Oomph! Rough lift off there, Kiara. That was as smooth as sandpaper!

>>But I am curious tho and it is the first thing on my mind...<<

For a moment hey eyes grow bigger, then they frantically wander around the room.

Calli's living room is small but cozy. There is a computer desk, a two person dining table, and some plants hanging down from the wall.

Earlier we lit and placed candles on top of the table. I find the flickering of a candle soothing. I could sit and just gaze upon a burning fire for hours.

>> just the two of us <<
>> our world <<
This setup provides just enough light to see each other's faces. The remaining space is veiled in gloom.

I keep staring at Calli until she gives me her answer. Oi oi Kiara, maybe turn down the intensity a bit... keep it cool!

>>and our eyes eventually meet.<<
She clears her throat in an attempt to bridge the past few seconds of silence, followed by a sip from her cup of wine.

"The flower bag... You mean the bag with the flower print?"

"Yaaas! The pink one." With a playful tone I add, "It looks so cute!"

>>And that.. is how you safely land on another thing to talk about.<< >>Double-u for Kiara!<<

A teensy-tiny grin breaks through Calli's otherwise stern face. She might not give this impression but pushing the right buttons will sway her just like anyone else.

"Yeah, I carry it around sometimes.. you know, for groceries and stuff. It's very functional."

I snigger, "Calli!! Just.. functional!? Aren't artists supposed to avoid bland and common vocabu-vocabularary?"

With a soft voice she lets out an "Ha haah!" and grins. "You got me there, Kusotori!"

>>At that point a realization hits me. Calli has too many trinkets that remind her of me!<<
She's right about that. Our friendship started so long ago; in fact, even before my first memory. 

Up until now I cannot remember any moment when she let me down. When I'm sad, she listens. When I'm happy, we celebrate.

I bought her sooo many trinkets in return. Each and everyone is attached to a special memory we made together.

I don't think she could ever forget about me.

"Well, I do strut around the city..."

"... Calli, I don't actually want to hear any words of appraisal right now." I blurted out to intentionally interrupt her.

"I know some feelings communicate better unspoken." That felt like a really wise thing to say, I'm barely holding back my smug face.

"Maybe put those words in your next song for me!"

She thinks about it for a second, "Yeah, maybe I'll do that!"

>>and goes for another sip of wine.<<
Her phone buzzes for attention. She takes it out of her pocket single-handed while the other reaches for the cup of wine.

"If you're ever stuck for words just call me, ok? This bird brain wants to help."

>> Calli continues slurping down her udon? <<
I get back just a nod of agreement as her concentration was claimed by the phone. That notification must be from manager-san.

>> Oblivious to the place my mind wandered <<
>>Sometimes I don't even understand myself.<<
She probably wrote me off as ~the usual~ weird behavior. But this situation must be hard for her too.

I'll remember how much you mean to me. For forever and longer... 

Arrgh! If only words were simpler! I'm sure you feel the same.

# Kiara's second breath

I don't feel like going outside...

Thick, grey, clouds are not letting a single ray of sunshine through.

I remember looking out over this 'Australian' valley and seeing an explosion of color. A beautiful palette of flowers and snow, coming straight out of a Bob Ross painting.

Sigh...

A little bit of damp sticks to the window, mixing what's outside into a blur.

Begrudgingly I fasten the laces on my shoes. "These aren't cute at all!"

Two weeks earlier I vented at my mom, about how my life changed since moving. She listened compassionately... but I didn't feel understood at all.

There is just such a stark difference between Japan and 'Australia'! Culture for one, but does it have to be sooo boring over here?!

Eventually, she presented me with a pair of hiking shoes. Her way of saying to get off my ass, I guess.

Thanks, mom, but next time I'll decide how I spend my time!

I take out my phone to double-check if I still remember the route of my trip. At least I did the planning myself.

Planning trips is fun. It's the anticipation that gets me really pumped up!

"0 unread messages"

With heavy feet, I walk towards our porch, at the front of the house.

My mom's standing in the hallway, but I pretend not to notice. As I pass by she goes in for a hug.

She's holding on pretty tight. I can feel her warmth through my cheeks and neck.

I close my eyes. She smells nice...

And then she let go. That took a second for me to realize. 

Still stunned I tried to remember for how long our hug lasted.

She looks me in the eye. Brightly smiling with a pinkish glow on her cheeks. 

"Be careful on your walk, sweetie." I nod back in reply.

I take a deep breath and push the door open. The colder outside air bonks me on the face.

Every breath tickles my lungs. No more weak knees or heavy feet.

"Today I'm gonna climb a mountain!"

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


This trip is planned from start to finish, at least that part I got to do myself.

Planning itself is a fun thing to do. Looking forward to something really pumps me up.

>>I could certainly use the excitement right now.<<

I miss her...


The internet has a lot of usable information about hiking trails, difficulty and user reviews. 

I picked one of the close by, easy routes. The starting point is at the other side of the meadow in front of our house.

The sight of our valley looks exactly the same as I remember. It's a box! A bunch of green meadows enclosed by towering high mountains.

I never liked the feeling of being a bird trapped in its cage. I want to fly! But everything I did made me end up back here.



I found a lot of data about walking paths and reviews on the internet.


Our house is built inside a valley surrounded by mountains. Literal mountains, like two thousand meter high and up.


I browsed the internet for hiking routes and picked one labelled easy. Its starting point is just up ahead.


Well, I knew this moment would pass. 

No, that's actually a lie. Mom forced me into this position by buying me these sturdy, waterproof shoes. I wonder if they're also fire proof...


Two weeks earlier my mom adviced me to take on a hobby. She listened to me venting, like all moms do, about how much has changed

I got this pair of shoes specifically for hiking the "Australian" mountains.

This sombre weather is 



"Be careful on your walk, sweetie." Mama phoenix shouted from doorway leading to the kitchen.

The sky is filled with thick grey clouds. Not a single ray of sunshine can break through. 

"This doesn't fit my original plan at all!" I shout at the sky. Recently I started hiking through the "Australian" mountains.

It's not a particulary fun activity, but planning it beforehand forces me to think more about my day to day activities.

Not that I needed more thinking. My enjoyment of hiking basically boils down to me clearing my head for two hours.



Not that it's a particulary fun activity, but it helps clear my head. Sitting at home 

========================================================================================================================

# Kiara's stumbling

The wind ruffles down the trees and into my ears.

The hills underneath my feet are becoming steeper.

My mind is quite lively even though I'm still quite tired from last night.

"Today I'm gonna climb a mountain!"

Don't think about what lies ahead. Think happy thoughts!

With every step I take, I'm getting stronger and stronger.

Heading through the forest, I recall the spots I used to hang out at.

The sun is still hidden behind the clouds and it gives the forest a mysterious and pretty glow.

And it's so silent. No birds chirping or insects buzzing.

All I can hear is the crackle of the thin logs underneath me.

My legs are still a bit numb, but I can feel strength pumping through my veins.

I'm fully aware that it's going to be a climb.

But still, I don't care. I'm not making any excuses.

My backback is heavy, but I'm happy about it. I'm not carrying any pointless stuff anyway.

The steep slope, the branches on my face...

I'm not going to let it stop me!

========================================================================================================================

# Kiara's [powering?]

I'm hoisting myself up the steep slope.

My breathing is so heavy. It's become really hard to take the next step.

I'm not sure if it's going to make or break me.

At this height the density of trees became sparse.

Needles of sunlight are piercing though thin, grey clouds.

>> Maybe make this the ending sentence?
I'll get to see a bright sky after all.

---

"I'm so proud of you, my little Minnie!"

My mom's beaming with pleasure, now that the whole ordeal is over.

"You know your dad and I were thinking, once you come back... you might wanna take over the business, so we can spend more time with you."

I don't want to feel like I'm being tied to this place by a rope, like I'll risk being dragged back anytime.

"I don't like that idea very much"

I stop for a moment. "But, you know, I don't really want to talk about it right now. I'll give it some thought."

I know she recognized my tone.

I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to think about it.

I don't want to be tied to a business that has nothing to do with me!

I don't want my parents to be thinking about this.

"Kiara, you can do whatever you want. If you want to be an artist, I'll support you. If you want to be a dancer, I'll support you. 

If you want to run a bar, I'll support you. Don't be afraid to be you, my baby."

Her words stand out in my mind.

My thoughts come to a halt. I briefly wonder what she meant by "Don't be afraid to be you".

My family will dismiss any business I do as a failure.

~Kiara's usual room sea chanty~

There once was a man who threw a fit at the moon
Boldly claiming an end real soon
The KF Police didn't know what to do
So they threw him in the usual room

Heeyoo, beware! beware!
Know what she will do to you
Heeyoo, beware! beware!
Tenchou will come after you!

# Dancing in the dark

*WOOOSH*

The incredibly small but sharp end of a scythe nearly sunk itself into my stomach. Had I not prepared to jump aside it would have cut my gut wide open.

I've seen 



I've lived a restless life. How couldn't I see?
Her beauty is ethereal. What have I done?
Was the destruction I sought worth it? Her touch is gentle. Now I understand...
What I longed for was a new beginning. Guided by her hand.
